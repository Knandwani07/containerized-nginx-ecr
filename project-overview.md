# 🚀 Containerized Web Application Deployment Using Docker and Amazon ECR

## Package once. Deploy anywhere.

Modern applications must run consistently across development, staging, and production environments.  
This project demonstrates how to containerize a web application using Docker, securely store the image in Amazon Elastic Container Registry (ECR), and validate the deployment using standard DevOps workflows.

---

## 🧩 Architecture Components

### 1. Docker Engine
Packages the application, runtime, and dependencies into a single immutable container image, ensuring consistent behavior across all environments.

### 2. Amazon Elastic Container Registry (ECR)
A fully managed, private container registry used to securely store and version Docker images with tight integration into AWS container services.

### 3. AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM)
Controls authentication and authorization for pushing and pulling images from ECR using least-privilege access policies.

### 4. AWS CLI
Provides command-line access to AWS services and enables secure authentication between Docker and Amazon ECR.

---

## 🔄 Container Image Workflow

1. The application is packaged into a Docker image using a Dockerfile.
2. AWS CLI authenticates Docker with Amazon ECR.
3. The container image is pushed to a private ECR repository.
4. The image is pulled and executed locally to validate the deployment.

## 💡 Why Containerization?

- Consistent application behavior across environments
- Portable deployments on any Docker-supported platform
- Simplified dependency management
- Secure, private image storage with IAM-based access control
- Faster build and deployment cycles

---

## 📚 Key Concepts Covered

- Container image lifecycle management
- Dockerfile creation and optimization
- Docker build, tag, and push workflows
- Secure authentication between Docker and AWS
- Private container registry configuration
- Image versioning and rollback strategies
